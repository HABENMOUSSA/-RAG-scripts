We wrote the first version of the Scrum Guide in 2010 to help\\npeople worldwide understand Scrum. We have evolved the Guide since then through small, functional\\nupdates. Together, we stand behind it.\\nThe Scrum Guide contains the definition of Scrum. Each element of the framework serves a specific\\npurpose that is essential to the overall value and results realized with Scrum. Changing the core design\\nor ideas of Scrum, leaving out elements, or not following the rules of Scrum, covers up problems and\\nlimits the benefits of Scrum, potentially even rendering it useless.\\nWe follow the growing use of Scrum within an ever-growing complex world. We are humbled to see\\nScrum being adopted in many domains holding essentially complex work, beyond software product\\ndevelopment where Scrum has its roots. As Scrum’s use spreads, developers, researchers, analysts,\\nscientists, and other specialists do the work. We use the word “developers” in Scrum not to exclude,\\nbut to simplify. If you get value from Scrum, consider yourself included.\\nAs Scrum is being used, patterns, processes, and insights that fit the Scrum framework as described in\\nthis document, may be found, applied and devised. Their description is beyond the purpose of the\\nScrum Guide because they are context sensitive and differ widely between Scrum uses. Such tactics for\\nusing within the Scrum framework vary widely and are described elsewhere.\\n\\nKen Schwaber & Jeff Sutherland November 2020\\n\\n                                   © 2020 Ken Schwaber and Jeff Sutherland\\n  This publication is offered for license under the Attribution Share-Alike license of Creative Commons,\\naccessible at https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/4.0/legalcode and also described in summary\\n\\n       form at https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/4.0/.

                                                          2\\n# Scrum Definition\\n\\nScrum is a lightweight framework that helps people, teams and organizations generate value through\\nadaptive solutions for complex problems.\\n\\nIn a nutshell, Scrum requires a Scrum Master to foster an environment where:\\n\\n    1. A Product Owner orders the work for a complex problem into a Product Backlog.\\n    2. The Scrum Team turns a selection of the work into an Increment of value during a Sprint.\\n    3. The Scrum Team and its stakeholders inspect the results and adjust for the next Sprint.\\n    4. Repeat\\n\\nScrum is simple. Try it as is and determine if its philosophy, theory, and structure help to achieve goals\\nand create value. The Scrum framework is purposefully incomplete, only defining the parts required to\\nimplement Scrum theory. Scrum is built upon by the collective intelligence of the people using it. Rather\\nthan provide people with detailed instructions, the rules of Scrum guide their relationships and\\ninteractions.\\n\\nVarious processes, techniques and methods can be employed within the framework. Scrum wraps\\naround existing practices or renders them unnecessary. Scrum makes visible the relative efficacy of\\ncurrent management, environment, and work techniques, so that improvements can be made.\\n\\n# Scrum Theory\\n\\nScrum is founded on empiricism and lean thinking. Empiricism asserts that knowledge comes from\\nexperience and making decisions based on what is observed. Lean thinking reduces waste and focuses\\non the essentials.\\n\\nScrum employs an iterative, incremental approach to optimize predictability and to control risk. Scrum\\nengages groups of people who collectively have all the skills and expertise to do the work and share or\\nacquire such skills as needed.\\n\\nScrum combines four formal events for inspection and adaptation within a containing event, the Sprint.\\nThese events work because they implement the empirical Scrum pillars of transparency, inspection, and\\nadaptation.\\n\\n# Transparency\\n\\nThe emergent process and work must be visible to those performing the work as well as those receiving\\nthe work. With Scrum, important decisions are based on the perceived state of its three formal artifacts.\\nArtifacts that have low transparency can lead to decisions that diminish value and increase risk.\\n\\n                                                                                                                               3\\nTransparency enables inspection. Inspection without transparency is misleading and wasteful.\\n\\n# Inspection\\n\\nThe Scrum artifacts and the progress toward agreed goals must be inspected frequently and diligently to\\ndetect potentially undesirable variances or problems. To help with inspection, Scrum provides cadence\\nin the form of its five events.\\n\\nInspection enables adaptation. Inspection without adaptation is considered pointless. Scrum events are\\ndesigned to provoke change.\\n\\n# Adaptation\\n\\nIf any aspects of a process deviate outside acceptable limits or if the resulting product is unacceptable,\\nthe process being applied or the materials being produced must be adjusted. The adjustment must be\\nmade as soon as possible to minimize further deviation.\\n\\nAdaptation becomes more difficult when the people involved are not empowered or self-managing. A\\nScrum Team is expected to adapt the moment it learns anything new through inspection.\\n\\n# Scrum Values\\n\\nSuccessful use of Scrum depends on people becoming more proficient in living five values:\\n                              Commitment, Focus, Openness, Respect, and Courage\\n\\nThe Scrum Team commits to achieving its goals and to supporting each other. Their primary focus is on\\nthe work of the Sprint to make the best possible progress toward these goals. The Scrum Team and its\\nstakeholders are open about the work and the challenges. Scrum Team members respect each other to\\nbe capable, independent people, and are respected as such by the people with whom they work. The\\nScrum Team members have the courage to do the right thing, to work on tough problems.\\n\\nThese values give direction to the Scrum Team with regard to their work, actions, and behavior. The\\ndecisions that are made, the steps taken, and the way Scrum is used should reinforce these values, not\\ndiminish or undermine them. The Scrum Team members learn and explore the values as they work with\\nthe Scrum events and artifacts. When these values are embodied by the Scrum Team and the people\\nthey work with, the empirical Scrum pillars of transparency, inspection, and adaptation come to life\\nbuilding trust.\\n\\n                                                                                                                               4\\n# Scrum Team\\n\\nThe fundamental unit of Scrum is a small team of people, a Scrum Team. The Scrum Team consists of\\none Scrum Master, one Product Owner, and Developers. Within a Scrum Team, there are no sub-teams\\nor hierarchies. It is a cohesive unit of professionals focused on one objective at a time, the Product Goal.\\n\\nScrum Teams are cross-functional, meaning the members have all the skills necessary to create value\\neach Sprint. They are also self-managing, meaning they internally decide who does what, when, and\\nhow.\\n\\nThe Scrum Team is small enough to remain nimble and large enough to complete significant work within\\na Sprint, typically 10 or fewer people. In general, we have found that smaller teams communicate better\\nand are more productive. If Scrum Teams become too large, they should consider reorganizing into\\nmultiple cohesive Scrum Teams, each focused on the same product. Therefore, they should share the\\nsame Product Goal, Product Backlog, and Product Owner.\\n\\nThe Scrum Team is responsible for all product-related activities from stakeholder collaboration,\\nverification, maintenance, operation, experimentation, research and development, and anything else\\nthat might be required. They are structured and empowered by the organization to manage their own\\nwork. Working in Sprints at a sustainable pace improves the Scrum Team’s focus and consistency.\\n\\nThe entire Scrum Team is accountable for creating a valuable, useful Increment every Sprint. Scrum\\ndefines three specific accountabilities within the Scrum Team: the Developers, the Product Owner, and\\nthe Scrum Master.\\n\\n# Developers\\n\\nDevelopers are the people in the Scrum Team that are committed to creating any aspect of a usable\\nIncrement each Sprint.\\n\\nThe specific skills needed by the Developers are often broad and will vary with the domain of work.\\nHowever, the Developers are always accountable for:\\n\\n    ● Creating a plan for the Sprint, the Sprint Backlog;\\n    ● Instilling quality by adhering to a Definition of Done;\\n    ● Adapting their plan each day toward the Sprint Goal; and,\\n    ● Holding each other accountable as professionals.\\n\\n# Product Owner\\n\\nThe Product Owner is accountable for maximizing the value of the product resulting from the work of\\nthe Scrum Team. How this is done may vary widely across organizations, Scrum Teams, and individuals.\\n\\n                                                                                                                               5\\nThe Product Owner is also accountable for effective Product Backlog management, which includes:\\n\\n    ● Developing and explicitly communicating the Product Goal;\\n    ● Creating and clearly communicating Product Backlog items;\\n    ● Ordering Product Backlog items; and,\\n    ● Ensuring that the Product Backlog is transparent, visible and understood.\\n\\nThe Product Owner may do the above work or may delegate the responsibility to others. Regardless, the\\nProduct Owner remains accountable.\\n\\nFor Product Owners to succeed, the entire organization must respect their decisions. These decisions\\nare visible in the content and ordering of the Product Backlog, and through the inspectable Increment at\\nthe Sprint Review.\\n\\nThe Product Owner is one person, not a committee. The Product Owner may represent the needs of\\nmany stakeholders in the Product Backlog. Those wanting to change the Product Backlog can do so by\\ntrying to convince the Product Owner.\\n\\n# Scrum Master\\n\\nThe Scrum Master is accountable for establishing Scrum as defined in the Scrum Guide. They do this by\\nhelping everyone understand Scrum theory and practice, both within the Scrum Team and the\\norganization.\\n\\nThe Scrum Master is accountable for the Scrum Team’s effectiveness. They do this by enabling the\\nScrum Team to improve its practices, within the Scrum framework.\\n\\nScrum Masters are true leaders who serve the Scrum Team and the larger organization.\\n\\nThe Scrum Master serves the Scrum Team in several ways, including:\\n\\n    ● Coaching the team members in self-management and cross-functionality;\\n    ● Helping the Scrum Team focus on creating high-value Increments that meet the Definition of\\n\\n         Done;\\n    ● Causing the removal of impediments to the Scrum Team’s progress; and,\\n    ● Ensuring that all Scrum events take place and are positive, productive, and kept within the\\n\\n         timebox.\\n\\nThe Scrum Master serves the Product Owner in several ways, including:\\n\\n                                                                                                                               6\\n    ● Helping find techniques for effective Product Goal definition and Product Backlog management;\\n    ● Helping the Scrum Team understand the need for clear and concise Product Backlog items;\\n    ● Helping establish empirical product planning for a complex environment; and,\\n    ● Facilitating stakeholder collaboration as requested or needed.\\n\\nThe Scrum Master serves the organization in several ways, including:\\n\\n    ● Leading, training, and coaching the organization in its Scrum adoption;\\n    ● Planning and advising Scrum implementations within the organization;\\n    ● Helping employees and stakeholders understand and enact an empirical approach for complex\\n\\n         work; and,\\n    ● Removing barriers between stakeholders and Scrum Teams.\\n\\n# Scrum Events\\n\\nThe Sprint is a container for all other events. Each event in Scrum is a formal opportunity to inspect and\\nadapt Scrum artifacts. These events are specifically designed to enable the transparency required.\\nFailure to operate any events as prescribed results in lost opportunities to inspect and adapt. Events are\\nused in Scrum to create regularity and to minimize the need for meetings not defined in Scrum.\\nOptimally, all events are held at the same time and place to reduce complexity.\\n\\n# The Sprint\\n\\nSprints are the heartbeat of Scrum, where ideas are turned into value.\\n\\nThey are fixed length events of one month or less to create consistency. A new Sprint starts immediately\\nafter the conclusion of the previous Sprint.\\n\\nAll the work necessary to achieve the Product Goal, including Sprint Planning, Daily Scrums, Sprint\\nReview, and Sprint Retrospective, happen within Sprints.\\n\\nDuring the Sprint:\\n\\n    ● No changes are made that would endanger the Sprint Goal;\\n    ● Quality does not decrease;\\n    ● The Product Backlog is refined as needed; and,\\n    ● Scope may be clarified and renegotiated with the Product Owner as more is learned.\\n\\nSprints enable predictability by ensuring inspection and adaptation of progress toward a Product Goal at\\nleast every calendar month. When a Sprint’s horizon is too long the Sprint Goal may become invalid,\\ncomplexity may rise, and risk may increase. Shorter Sprints can be employed to generate more learning\\n\\n                                                                                                                               7\\ncycles and limit risk of cost and effort to a smaller time frame. Each Sprint may be considered a short\\nproject.\\n\\nVarious practices exist to forecast progress, like burn-downs, burn-ups, or cumulative flows. While\\nproven useful, these do not replace the importance of empiricism. In complex environments, what will\\nhappen is unknown. Only what has already happened may be used for forward-looking decision making.\\n\\nA Sprint could be cancelled if the Sprint Goal becomes obsolete. Only the Product Owner has the\\nauthority to cancel the Sprint.\\n\\n# Sprint Planning\\n\\nSprint Planning initiates the Sprint by laying out the work to be performed for the Sprint. This resulting\\nplan is created by the collaborative work of the entire Scrum Team.\\n\\nThe Product Owner ensures that attendees are prepared to discuss the most important Product Backlog\\nitems and how they map to the Product Goal. The Scrum Team may also invite other people to attend\\nSprint Planning to provide advice.\\n\\nSprint Planning addresses the following topics:\\n\\nTopic One: Why is this Sprint valuable?\\nThe Product Owner proposes how the product could increase its value and utility in the current Sprint.\\nThe whole Scrum Team then collaborates to define a Sprint Goal that communicates why the Sprint is\\nvaluable to stakeholders. The Sprint Goal must be finalized prior to the end of Sprint Planning.\\n\\nTopic Two: What can be Done this Sprint?\\nThrough discussion with the Product Owner, the Developers select items from the Product Backlog to\\ninclude in the current Sprint. The Scrum Team may refine these items during this process, which\\nincreases understanding and confidence.\\n\\nSelecting how much can be completed within a Sprint may be challenging. However, the more the\\nDevelopers know about their past performance, their upcoming capacity, and their Definition of Done,\\nthe more confident they will be in their Sprint forecasts.\\n\\nTopic Three: How will the chosen work get done?\\nFor each selected Product Backlog item, the Developers plan the work necessary to create an Increment\\nthat meets the Definition of Done. This is often done by decomposing Product Backlog items into\\nsmaller work items of one day or less. How this is done is at the sole discretion of the Developers. No\\none else tells them how to turn Product Backlog items into Increments of value.\\n\\n                                                                                                                               8\\nThe Sprint Goal, the Product Backlog items selected for the Sprint, plus the plan for delivering them are\\ntogether referred to as the Sprint Backlog.\\n\\nSprint Planning is timeboxed to a maximum of eight hours for a one-month Sprint. For shorter Sprints,\\nthe event is usually shorter.\\n\\n# Daily Scrum\\n\\nThe purpose of the Daily Scrum is to inspect progress toward the Sprint Goal and adapt the Sprint\\nBacklog as necessary, adjusting the upcoming planned work.\\n\\nThe Daily Scrum is a 15-minute event for the Developers of the Scrum Team. To reduce complexity, it is\\nheld at the same time and place every working day of the Sprint. If the Product Owner or Scrum Master\\nare actively working on items in the Sprint Backlog, they participate as Developers.\\n\\nThe Developers can select whatever structure and techniques they want, as long as their Daily Scrum\\nfocuses on progress toward the Sprint Goal and produces an actionable plan for the next day of work.\\nThis creates focus and improves self-management.\\n\\nDaily Scrums improve communications, identify impediments, promote quick decision-making, and\\nconsequently eliminate the need for other meetings.\\n\\nThe Daily Scrum is not the only time Developers are allowed to adjust their plan. They often meet\\nthroughout the day for more detailed discussions about adapting or re-planning the rest of the Sprint’s\\nwork.\\n\\n# Sprint Review\\n\\nThe purpose of the Sprint Review is to inspect the outcome of the Sprint and determine future\\nadaptations. The Scrum Team presents the results of their work to key stakeholders and progress\\ntoward the Product Goal is discussed.\\n\\nDuring the event, the Scrum Team and stakeholders review what was accomplished in the Sprint and\\nwhat has changed in their environment. Based on this information, attendees collaborate on what to do\\nnext. The Product Backlog may also be adjusted to meet new opportunities. The Sprint Review is a\\nworking session and the Scrum Team should avoid limiting it to a presentation.\\n\\nThe Sprint Review is the second to last event of the Sprint and is timeboxed to a maximum of four hours\\nfor a one-month Sprint. For shorter Sprints, the event is usually shorter.\\n\\n                                                                                                                               9\\n# Sprint Retrospective\\n\\nThe purpose of the Sprint Retrospective is to plan ways to increase quality and effectiveness.\\n\\nThe Scrum Team inspects how the last Sprint went with regards to individuals, interactions, processes,\\ntools, and their Definition of Done. Inspected elements often vary with the domain of work.\\nAssumptions that led them astray are identified and their origins explored. The Scrum Team discusses\\nwhat went well during the Sprint, what problems it encountered, and how those problems were (or\\nwere not) solved.\\n\\nThe Scrum Team identifies the most helpful changes to improve its effectiveness. The most impactful\\nimprovements are addressed as soon as possible. They may even be added to the Sprint Backlog for the\\nnext Sprint.\\n\\nThe Sprint Retrospective concludes the Sprint. It is timeboxed to a maximum of three hours for a one-\\nmonth Sprint. For shorter Sprints, the event is usually shorter.\\n\\n# Scrum Artifacts\\n\\nScrum’s artifacts represent work or value. They are designed to maximize transparency of key\\ninformation. Thus, everyone inspecting them has the same basis for adaptation.\\n\\nEach artifact contains a commitment to ensure it provides information that enhances transparency and\\nfocus against which progress can be measured:\\n\\n    ● For the Product Backlog it is the Product Goal.\\n    ● For the Sprint Backlog it is the Sprint Goal.\\n    ● For the Increment it is the Definition of Done.\\n\\nThese commitments exist to reinforce empiricism and the Scrum values for the Scrum Team and their\\nstakeholders.\\n\\n# Product Backlog\\n\\nThe Product Backlog is an emergent, ordered list of what is needed to improve the product. It is the\\nsingle source of work undertaken by the Scrum Team.\\n\\nProduct Backlog items that can be Done by the Scrum Team within one Sprint are deemed ready for\\nselection in a Sprint Planning event. They usually acquire this degree of transparency after refining\\nactivities. Product Backlog refinement is the act of breaking down and further defining Product Backlog\\nitems into smaller more precise items. This is an ongoing activity to add details, such as a description,\\norder, and size. Attributes often vary with the domain of work.\\n\\n                                                                                                                             10\\nThe Developers who will be doing the work are responsible for the sizing. The Product Owner may\\ninfluence the Developers by helping them understand and select trade-offs.\\n\\nCommitment: Product Goal\\n\\nThe Product Goal describes a future state of the product which can serve as a target for the Scrum Team\\nto plan against. The Product Goal is in the Product Backlog. The rest of the Product Backlog emerges to\\ndefine “what” will fulfill the Product Goal.\\n\\n         A product is a vehicle to deliver value. It has a clear boundary, known stakeholders, well-defined\\n         users or customers. A product could be a service, a physical product, or something more abstract.\\n\\nThe Product Goal is the long-term objective for the Scrum Team. They must fulfill (or abandon) one\\nobjective before taking on the next.\\n\\n# Sprint Backlog\\n\\nThe Sprint Backlog is composed of the Sprint Goal (why), the set of Product Backlog items selected for\\nthe Sprint (what), as well as an actionable plan for delivering the Increment (how).\\n\\nThe Sprint Backlog is a plan by and for the Developers. It is a highly visible, real-time picture of the work\\nthat the Developers plan to accomplish during the Sprint in order to achieve the Sprint Goal.\\nConsequently, the Sprint Backlog is updated throughout the Sprint as more is learned. It should have\\nenough detail that they can inspect their progress in the Daily Scrum.\\n\\nCommitment: Sprint Goal\\n\\nThe Sprint Goal is the single objective for the Sprint. Although the Sprint Goal is a commitment by the\\nDevelopers, it provides flexibility in terms of the exact work needed to achieve it. The Sprint Goal also\\ncreates coherence and focus, encouraging the Scrum Team to work together rather than on separate\\ninitiatives.\\n\\nThe Sprint Goal is created during the Sprint Planning event and then added to the Sprint Backlog. As the\\nDevelopers work during the Sprint, they keep the Sprint Goal in mind. If the work turns out to be\\ndifferent than they expected, they collaborate with the Product Owner to negotiate the scope of the\\nSprint Backlog within the Sprint without affecting the Sprint Goal.\\n\\n# Increment\\n\\nAn Increment is a concrete stepping stone toward the Product Goal. Each Increment is additive to all\\nprior Increments and thoroughly verified, ensuring that all Increments work together. In order to\\nprovide value, the Increment must be usable.\\n\\n                                                                                                                             11\\nMultiple Increments may be created within a Sprint. The sum of the Increments is presented at the\\nSprint Review thus supporting empiricism. However, an Increment may be delivered to stakeholders\\nprior to the end of the Sprint. The Sprint Review should never be considered a gate to releasing value.\\nWork cannot be considered part of an Increment unless it meets the Definition of Done.\\n\\nCommitment: Definition of Done\\n\\nThe Definition of Done is a formal description of the state of the Increment when it meets the quality\\nmeasures required for the product.\\nThe moment a Product Backlog item meets the Definition of Done, an Increment is born.\\nThe Definition of Done creates transparency by providing everyone a shared understanding of what\\nwork was completed as part of the Increment. If a Product Backlog item does not meet the Definition of\\nDone, it cannot be released or even presented at the Sprint Review. Instead, it returns to the Product\\nBacklog for future consideration.\\nIf the Definition of Done for an increment is part of the standards of the organization, all Scrum Teams\\nmust follow it as a minimum. If it is not an organizational standard, the Scrum Team must create a\\nDefinition of Done appropriate for the product.\\nThe Developers are required to conform to the Definition of Done. If there are multiple Scrum Teams\\nworking together on a product, they must mutually define and comply with the same Definition of Done.\\n\\n                                                                                                                             12\\n# End Note\\n\\nScrum is free and offered in this Guide.
